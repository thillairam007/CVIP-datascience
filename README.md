# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Terrorism Dataset

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the terrorism dataset to extract meaningful insights and patterns. The analysis aims to uncover trends, identify high-risk regions, understand attack characteristics, and potentially reveal factors that contribute to terrorist activities.

## Dataset

The terrorism dataset used in this analysis is sourced from [Global Terrorism Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13sWGvTneTU2ozu-hziqCLm67UjewlDsT/view?usp=sharing) and contains information about terrorist incidents worldwide.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps to perform EDA

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)
- Required Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Altair)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```python
# Clone the GitHub repository
!git clone https://github.com/thillairam007/CVIP-datascience
```
2. Install the required Python libraries (check requirement.txt)
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook **terroristattack.ipynb**


## Analysis Overview

The EDA consists of the following key steps:

**1. Data Collection:** Gather the terrorism dataset from a reliable source.

**2. Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the dataset, handle missing values, and format data types.

**3. Data Exploration:** Summarize the dataset, visualize data distributions, and calculate basic statistics.

**4. Geographic Analysis:** Plot geographical distribution of terrorist incidents.

**5. Temporal Analysis:** Analyze the frequency of terrorist incidents over time.

**6. Categorical Analysis:** Explore categorical variables like attack types and target types.

**7. Correlation Analysis:** Investigate correlations between variables.

**8. Factors Analysis:** Analyze factors contributing to terrorist activities.

**9. Data Storytelling:** Summarize findings and insights using visualizations.

**10. Recommendations:** Provide recommendations based on the analysis.

**11. Future Work:** Suggest potential further analyses or predictive modeling.




## Results

The analysis reveals patterns in terrorist incidents, high-risk regions, and attack characteristics. It also explores potential factors contributing to terrorism.
